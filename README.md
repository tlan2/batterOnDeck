A Major League Baseball (MLB) dashboard containing player's individual season and career stats using the [MLB Data API](https://appac.github.io/mlb-data-api-docs/). Search for player by name and see all their season or career positional stats!

## API
Batter On Deck uses promises to gather and fetch data from MLB Data API to supply our website with player info. We used 3 of the main API calls to pull players' personal, seasonal and career data. We had to mix and match them in order to retrieve all the needed information. You can learn more about the other API calls at [https://appac.github.io/mlb-data-api-docs/](https://appac.github.io/mlb-data-api-docs/).
