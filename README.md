## API
Batter On Deck uses promises to gather and fetch data from MLB Data API to supply our website with player info. We used 3 of the main API calls to pull players' personal, seasonal and career data. We had to mix and match them in order to retrieve all the needed information. You can learn more about the other API calls at [https://appac.github.io/mlb-data-api-docs/](https://appac.github.io/mlb-data-api-docs/).

## Tools
1. HTML
2. CSS
    A. Bootstrap
3. Javascript

We used Javascript for our back-end logic, HTML for our website content, and CSS and Boostrap for our styling.
