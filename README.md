## API
Batter On Deck uses promises to gather and fetch data from MLB Data API to suppy our website with player info. We used 3 of the main API calls on players' personal, seasonal and career data. We had to mix and match a few of the calls to account for retired or active players in order to pull all the needed information. You can learn more about the other API calls at [https://appac.github.io/mlb-data-api-docs/](https://appac.github.io/mlb-data-api-docs/).

### Tools
1. HTML
2. CSS
    A. Bootstrap
3. Javascript

We used Javascript for our back-end logic, HTML for our website content, and CSS and Boostrap for our styling.
